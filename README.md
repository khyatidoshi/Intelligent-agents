The problem statement is to design five different types of agents in a maze (51*51 grid) consisting of ghosts. The agent dies if the agent and the ghost are in the same cell. Each agent comes with it’s own capabilities and it’s goal is to reach the bottom right corner of the maze from the top left corner.
